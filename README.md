### Hi there 👋
My name is Dmitriy and I'm a beginner ML engineer.

🌱 I'm currently finishing my studies at TUSUR University and taking courses from Founder Academy.  
🎮 As a hobby, I was involved in writing mods and resource packs for minecraft, hosting and moderating servers.  
🤔 I have a lot of experience in reading other people's code, but I have relatively little experience in writing my own.
